Welcome to Memory Lane

Hey there,

Welcome to Memory Lane, a space where we're weaving stories together, not just for ourselves but for everyone.

I know there's a chance this might catch some attention, and maybe down the line, it could morph into something beyond us. But I'm really hoping you jump in and be a part of what we're calling "The Memoirs Platform."

Here's the scoop: I want to create a spot where anyone, without jumping through hoops, can jot down their memories. You get to pick a day – any day – from the past or even the future. Imagine, a collection of memories from people you've never met. It's not just a cool idea; it's a way to bring a different kind of poetry back into our lives.

This space will live online, a website kind of thing. But here's the twist – I hope, and trust you'll get why, that this site is wide open. No sign-ups, no gatekeepers moderating what goes in. These "memories" should be for everyone. It's a bit magical because it breaks the rules of time, and I think everyone should be a part of it. Now, beyond the magic and good vibes, this project is solid. It's about keeping things positive, and no one's getting gold stars for what they write.

So, if you're in, you're just one of us – no titles, no fancy status.

Let's make memories.
