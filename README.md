# Welcome to Memory Lane

Hello, it's time to get back to work, poets.
Help me awaken the monad, the whole, the source.

I also know that it will attract a lot of interest, and it's possible that a version will be created without our participation. However, I'd like you to get involved in this project, which we'll call "The Memoirs Platform". 

Here's the basic text: I want to make a place where anyone without registration could write their memoirs by choosing a specific day in the past or future. The result would be a collection of the memories of unknown people. This could help save the world and re-establish a new poetry of humanity. 

This space will be digital, and a website can do the trick. However, I hope - and you'll all understand why this is necessary - that this site will be completely open. The idea is to create no barriers, no moderation so to speak, and to open up these "memories" to all without registration. This is an exciting project because it abolishes the idea of time, and everyone has the right to participate. Beyond the magic of the idea and everyone's good will, I draw your attention to the soundness of this project. No negative energy will be taken into consideration, and no one will be rewarded for their work.

If you're in, you are a nobody. There's a certain beauty in that.

The Monad
